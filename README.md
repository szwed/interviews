1. Looking at the below code, write down the final values of A0, A1, â€¦An.
```
A0 = dict(zip(('a','b','c','d','e'),(1,2,3,4,5)))
A1 = range(10)A2 = sorted([i for i in A1 if i in A0])
A3 = sorted([A0[s] for s in A0])
A4 = [i for i in A1 if i in A3]
A5 = {i:i*i for i in A1}
A6 = [[i,i*i] for i in A1]


A0 = ?
A1 = ?
A2 = ?
A3 = ?
A4 = ?
A5 = ?
A6 = ?
```
